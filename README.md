# SqueezeNet_vs_CIFAR10
Inspired by the 'SqueezeNet' proposed by Forrest Iandola et al. (2016) architecture, created a smaller model for CIFAR-10 data set using similar components (fire module, etc). 

@article{SqueezeNet,
    Author = {Forrest N. Iandola and Song Han and Matthew W. Moskewicz and Khalid Ashraf and William J. Dally and Kurt Keutzer},
    Title = {SqueezeNet: AlexNet-level accuracy with 50x fewer parameters and $<$0.5MB model size},
    Journal = {arXiv:1602.07360},
